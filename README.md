# Slot-Machines
## A few words about copyright...
Funny and simple slots Android app. The app was developed by me (__Bogdan ChisÄƒlescu__) and my fellow colleague __Negoescu Raul__. 
The purpose of this app is __*strictly educational and we DO NOT own any copyrights for the images or graphical elements with few 
exceptions. We DID NOT gain any commercial or financial benefits out of someone else's work*__.
As mentioned before, the copyright we claim in the app is not a valid one.
## Now about the app
Sweeping through the menus you'll be able to see that the app only runs in landscape mode and a button is inactive in the main menu, that
is because the finals were approaching and neighter of us had the time to complete it's functionality. The same is true about the "auto 
spin" function. The button in the main menu was supposed to show the total amount of money a user had.
